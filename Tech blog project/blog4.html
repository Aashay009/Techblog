            ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm. It’s able to write essays, code and more given short text prompts, hyper-charging productivity. But it also has a more…nefarious side.
            <br><br>
            In any case, AI tools are not going away — and indeed has expanded dramatically since its launch just a few months ago. Major brands are experimenting with it, using the AI to generate ad and marketing copy, for example. 
            <br><br>
            And OpenAI is heavily investing in it. ChatGPT was recently super-charged by GPT-4, the latest language-writing model from OpenAI’s labs. Paying ChatGPT users have access to GPT-4, which can write more naturally and fluently than the model that previously powered ChatGPT. In addition to GPT-4, OpenAI recently connected ChatGPT to the internet with plugins available in alpha to users and developers on the waitlist.

            <b>What companies use ChatGPT?<br><br></b>
            Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.
            <br><br>
            Most recently, Microsoft announced at it’s 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.
            <br><br>
            <b>What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?<br><br></b>
            GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.
            <br><br>
            <b>What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?<br><br></b>
            Everyday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.
            <br><br>
            <b>What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?<br><br></b>
            Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.
            <br><br>
            <b>How good is ChatGPT at writing code?<br><br></b>
            It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.
            <br><br>
            <b>Can you save a ChatGPT chat?<br><br></b>
            Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.
            <br><br>
            <b>Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?<br><br></b>
            Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Bard and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives. But the latter are harder — if not impossible — to run today.
