        <h1>Blue owned the consumer podcast mic market – now the brand is being phased out</h1></div>

            Blue Microphones was ahead of the game. The first Snowball was released all the way back in 2005, as the company was celebrating its 10th birthday. Within a few years, the USB mics were everywhere. They were effectively synonymous with the nascent world of amateur podcasting and became a go-to for first-time content creators uploading video to a brand-new site called YouTube.
            <br><br>
            A few years later, the company released another game changer in the form of the Yeti – a step up from the Snowball in terms of sound, functionality and, naturally, price. There have been other additions to the consumer line, including the ultra portable Raspberry and Mo-Fi over ear headphones, but the Snowball and Yeti have long remained brand tentpoles.
            <br><br>
            While the company has made plenty of higher-end audio products over the years, it’s clear that consumer products generally – and the Yeti specifically – were what Logitech was most interested in when it purchased the brand in 2018. The company was rolled into the peripheral maker’s portfolio, while retaining its own brand identity.
            <br><br>
            “Logitech is delighted to welcome all Blue employees plus contractors to Logitech,” a spokesperson told me at the time. “The brand is also welcomed into Logitech’s broader portfolio.”
            <br><br>
            It seems that Logitech is ready to end that era, however, sunsetting the Blue branding, as its products are being absorbed into its G line. The company confirmed the move in a related FAQ, writing, “We will be keeping the Yeti brand and moving it under Logitech G. The Blue name will be used to describe our technologies.”
            <br><br>
            The example it gives for the latter is BLUEVO!CE, a noise reduction technology that Logitech uses on its headsets. Effectively, the Blue Yeti is now the Logitech G Yeti. Based on the language offered up here, things don’t bode well for the continued existence of the Snowball and other non-Yeti Blue products. We’ve reached out to Logitech for clarification.
            <br><br>
            It’s clear that Logitech always saw the Yeti as a game-streaming accessory, a case its continued to make over the years to the point of phasing out Blue altogether. The company’s Astro brand is also being moved under the G line, but the name will live to see another day.
            <br><br>
            “Astro will continue to live on as a premium console audio product series underneath the Logitech G brand,” it writes. “Stay tuned for more information regarding Astro, including a launch that we think our community will be very excited about.”
